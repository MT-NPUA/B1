    settings.__init__
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        Applications need some kind of configuration. There are different
        settings you might want to change depending on the application
        environment like toggling the debug mode, setting the secret key, and
        other such environment-specific things.

        The way Application is designed usually requires the configuration to
        be available when the application starts up. You can hard code the
        configuration in the code, which for many small applications is not
        actually that bad, but there are better ways.

        Independent of how you load your config, there is a config object
        available which holds the loaded configuration values: The config
        attribute of the Application object. This is the place where
        Application itself puts certain configuration values and also where
        extensions can put their configuration values. But this is also where
        you can have your own configuration.
