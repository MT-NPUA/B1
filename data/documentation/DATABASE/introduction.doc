What is Data?
-------------
  In simple words, data can be facts related to any object in consideration. For
  example, your name, age, height, weight, etc. are some data related to you. A
  picture, image, file, pdf, etc. can also be considered data.



What is Database?
-----------------
  A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage
  and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. Let us discuss
  a database example: An online telephone directory uses a database to store
  data of people, phone numbers, and other contact details. Your electricity
  service provider uses a database to manage billing, client-related issues,
  handle fault data, etc. Let us also consider Facebook. It needs to store,
  manipulate, and present data related to members, their friends, member
  activities, messages, advertisements, and a lot more. We can provide a
  countless number of examples for the usage of databases.



Distributed databases:
----------------------
  A distributed database is a type of database that has contributions from the
  common database and information captured by local computers. In this type of
  database system, the data is not in one place and is distributed at various
  organizations.



Relational databases:
---------------------
  This type of database defines database relationships in the form of tables.
  It is also called Relational DBMS, which is the most popular DBMS type in the
  market. Database example of the RDBMS system include MySQL, Oracle, and
  Microsoft SQL Server database.



Object-oriented databases:
--------------------------
  This type of computers database supports the storage of all data types. The
  data is stored in the form of objects. The objects to be held in the database
  have attributes and methods that define what to do with the data. PostgreSQL
  is an example of an object-oriented relational DBMS.



Centralized database:
---------------------
  It is a centralized location, and users from different backgrounds can access
  this data. This type of computers databases store application procedures that
  help users access the data even from a remote location.



Open-source databases:
----------------------
  This kind of database stored information related to operations. It is mainly
  used in the field of marketing, employee relations, customer service, of
  databases.



Cloud databases:
----------------
  A cloud database is a database which is optimized or built for such a
  virtualized environment. There are so many advantages of a cloud database,
  some of which can pay for storage capacity and bandwidth. It also offers
  scalability on-demand, along with high availability.



Data warehouses:
----------------
  Data Warehouse is to facilitate a single version of truth for a company for
  decision making and forecasting. A Data warehouse is an information system
  that contains historical and commutative data from single or multiple sources.
  Data Warehouse concept simplifies the reporting and analysis process of the
  organization.



NoSQL databases:
----------------
  NoSQL database is used for large sets of distributed data. There are a few big
  data performance problems that are effectively handled by relational
  databases. This type of computers database is very efficient in analyzing
  large-size unstructured data.



Graph databases:
----------------
  A graph-oriented database uses graph theory to store, map, and query
  relationships. These kinds of computers databases are mostly used for
  analyzing interconnections. For example, an organization can use a graph
  database to mine data about customers from social media.



OLTP databases:
---------------
  OLTP another database type which able to perform fast query processing and
  maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments.



Personal database:
------------------
  A personal database is used to store data stored on personal computers that
  are smaller and easily manageable. The data is mostly used by the same
  department of the company and is accessed by a small group of people.



Multimodal database:
--------------------
  The multimodal database is a type of data processing platform that supports
  multiple data models that define how the certain knowledge and information in
  a database should be organized and arranged.



Document/JSON database:
-----------------------
  In a document-oriented database, the data is kept in document collections,
  usually using the XML, JSON, BSON formats. One record can store as much data
  as you want, in any data type (or types) you prefer.



Hierarchical:
-------------
  This type of DBMS employs the “parent-child” relationship of storing data. Its
  structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches
  representing fields. The windows registry used in Windows XP is a hierarchical
  database example.



Network DBMS:
-------------
  This type of DBMS supports many-to-many relations. It usually results in
  complex database structures. RDM Server is an example of database management
  system that implements the network model. This is a set of programs used to
  manage and control the overall database. This includes the database software
  itself, the Operating System, the network software used to share the data
  among users, and the application programs for accessing data in the database.
