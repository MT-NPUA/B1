DESCRIPTION:
------------
  In computing, an application programming interface is an interface that
  defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed
  hardware-software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests
  that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the
  conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that
  users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying
  degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed
  based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information
  hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface
  independently of the implementation. Reference to Web APIs is currently the
  most common use of the term. There are also APIs for programming languages,
  software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs
  originated in the 1940s, though the term API did not emerge until the 1960s
  and 70s.


API Strategy Resources:
-----------------------
  An API strategy is a critical component of digital transformation. Over the
  years, the term “API” (which stands for Application Programming Interface)
  has been used generically to describe a connectivity interface to an
  application. However, modern APIs have taken on some characteristics that
  distinguish them from poorly designed APIs of the past:

  Modern APIs adhere to standards (typically HTTP and REST), that are
  developer-friendly, easily accessible and understood broadly. They are
  treated more like products than code. APIs are designed for consumption for
  specific audiences (e.g., mobile developers), they are documented, and they
  are versioned in a way that users can have certain expectations of its
  maintenance and lifecycle. Because they are much more standardized, today's
  APIs have a much stronger discipline for security and governance, as well as
  monitored and managed for performance and scale.

  When an organization strategically envisions APIs as engines for new
  products, new business channels, and new business models in ways that
  ultimately produce new revenue or other measurable value, that organization
  is said to be monetizing its APIs. In aggregate, the organizations around the
  world that directly or indirectly monetize their APIs form the basis of what
  the media often calls the “API economy.” As a subset of the total global
  economy, the API economy is annually responsible for the exchange of
  trillions of dollars.

  Taken together, an organization, its platform of APIs, the channels of
  platform availability, and the various constituencies to which those APIs are
  available (internal developers, external developers, partners, customers, and
  more) can form a thriving ecosystem.
