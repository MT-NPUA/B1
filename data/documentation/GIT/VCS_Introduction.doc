CONTROL SYSTEM:
---------------
  This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git
  can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store
  code due to the other features it provides.


VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM:
-----------------------
  The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code
  is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So
  Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining
  a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides
  features like branches and merges, which I will be covering
  later.


DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM:
-----------------------------------
  Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a
  local repository which is stored in the computer of each
  developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a
  central server, but the full copy of the code is present in
  all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version
  Control System since the code is present in every developer’s
  computer. I will explain the concept of remote and local
  repositories later in this article.
